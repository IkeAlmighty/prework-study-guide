        <li>
          do not use a higher tiered tag in the scope of a lower tier one. Ex. DO NOT nest an h2 tag inside of h3,
          h4, h5, or h6 tags.

          use *semantic tags* wherever it makes sense. Semantic tags are those that describe their use on the page

          as nav, body, header, button, etc)

        <li><strong>main/production branch</strong> - This is where the most stable version of the project code lives,
          and also often sometimes where the production code lives. It is the base branch for the develop branch.</li>
        <li><strong>develop branch</strong> - This is the base branch for feature and release branches.</li>
        <li><strong>feature branch</strong> - A feature branch is where new features are developed. Once the feature is
          fully developed, it is merged into the develop branch and the feature branch is deleted.</li>
        <li><strong>release branch</strong> - A release branch is created with the devlop branch as it&#39;s base. Code
          reviews are generally done on the release branch, and if all the reviews are passed then it is merged into the
          main/production branch.</li>
        <li><strong>hotfix branch</strong> - a hotfix branch uses the main/production branch as it&#39;s base branch.
          Hotfixes branches are created when a feature that has already passed code review and been merged into
          main/production needs corrected.</li>
